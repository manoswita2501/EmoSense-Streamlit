## Description

EmoSense is a Python web app utilizing TextBlob for sentiment analysis of user-provided text. Users enter text as input, which is then analyzed for polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) and subjectivity. Results are presented with emoticons reflecting the sentiment, alongside numerical scores for polarity and subjectivity. The application also provides detailed explanations of the sentiment analysis outcome along with visualization to aid users in understanding the emotional tone conveyed by their input. In addition, this web app can also analyze sentiment in text data from CSV files. When a CSV file is uploaded, EmoSense automatically processes each entry using TextBlob for sentiment analysis. It calculates polarity and subjectivity scores for each entry and categorizes them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score.
