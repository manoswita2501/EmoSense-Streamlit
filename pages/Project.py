        EmoSense employs TextBlob, a natural language processing library in Python, to conduct sentiment analysis 
        on user-entered text. The workflow of the application begins with the user inputting text into a designated 
        text area. Upon submission, EmoSense utilizes TextBlob's sentiment analysis capabilities to process the input. 
        TextBlob analyzes the text's polarity and subjectivity, providing a sentiment label indicating whether the 
        text is positive, negative, or neutral, along with numerical values representing polarity and subjectivity scores. 
        
        Additionally, EmoSense incorporates a graphical representation of the sentiment analysis results, displaying 
        emoticons corresponding to the detected sentiment (such as üòÉ for positive, üòû for negative, and üòê for neutral). 
        Furthermore, the application offers a detailed explanation of the sentiment analysis outcome, aiding users in 
        understanding the emotional tone conveyed by the input text.

        In addition to analyzing sentiment in real-time text input, EmoSense extends its functionality to perform 
        sentiment analysis on data entered via CSV files. Upon uploading a CSV file containing text data, EmoSense 
        automatically processes each entry within the file using the same sentiment analysis techniques employed for 
        real-time text input. Leveraging the TextBlob library, EmoSense computes polarity and subjectivity scores for 
        each entry, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment label derived from the 
        polarity score.
